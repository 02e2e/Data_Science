# The aim of this case study is to to build a linear regression model using L1, L2 regularization, and ElasticNet. The task is to predict the Critical Temperature as closely as possible using the Super-Conductor dataset. In addition, include in your write-up which variable carries the most importance and the best regularization parameter for each model.
