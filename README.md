# CASE-STUDY1: (Linear Regression)
    # The aim of this case study is to to build a linear regression model using L1, L2 regularization, and ElasticNet. The task is to predict the Critical Temperature as closely as possible using the Super-Conductor dataset. In addition, include in your write-up which variable carries the most importance and the best regularization parameter for each model. 

# CASE-STUDY2: (Imputation and Logisitic Regression)
    # Your case study is to build a classifier using logistic regression to predict hospital readmittance. There is missing data that must be imputed. Once again, discuss variable importances as part of your submission.
